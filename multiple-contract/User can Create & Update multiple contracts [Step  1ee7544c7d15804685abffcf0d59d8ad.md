Updated At: May 9, 2025

# Acceptance Criteria

### üìò¬†**User Journey: Multiple Contract Creation via API**

### **Step 1: Upload & Basic Setup**

- **Action**: User uploads contracts via API (minimum 2, maximum 10 contracts per request).
- **Validations**:
    - 
    - Must upload¬†**at least 2 contracts**, max¬†**10**.
    - Each contract must include:
        - PDF file (only one per contract)
        - Includes error cases
        - Application Type (mandatory)
- ‚ùó¬†**Error Handling**:
    
    If any required field is missing, the system will prevent progressing to Step 2.
    
- **Common for Multi contracts**
    - Workflow Template
    - Partner Company (not representative name)
    - Contract Method (e-Contract only)
    - PIC User
    - Remarks / Comments (Memo)
- **Partner Selection & ‚ÄúAdd More‚Äù Option**¬†is provided for adding counterparty details.
- ‚úÖ¬†**Validation**:
    
    All contracts in the batch¬†**must**¬†have the same values for these shared settings. If any mismatch is found, an error is returned will not proceed to Step 2
    

---

### **Step 2: Workflow & Partner Selection**

**User Action:**

- Selects:
    - **Internal Workflow Template**
    - **Partner Company ‚Üí R**epresentative Name

### ‚úÖ¬†**Out of Scope**

- **Step 3 (Stamp Setting)**¬†is excluded from this batch API flow.
    
    ‚Üí Existing contract stamp configuration will apply separately post-creation.
    

---

- **Step 4: Submit Contracts**
    - Review and Submit
    - Single click for entire contract

---

### üìù¬†**Important Notes**

- **üìß Email Notification**:
    
    Only¬†**one notification email**¬†is sent per batch, regardless of the number of contracts created.
    
- **üìé One Document Per Contract**:
    
    Each contract supports¬†**only one PDF upload**¬†at creation time.
    
- **üìå Common Batch Settings Include**:
    - Contract Type
    - Document Type
    - Partner Reminder Settings

Draft Note : 

- The user can create a multiple (1-10) contracts at once, which are to be in the sending box, per request.
    - Each contract can have different Contract Name, Application Template and Contract Type.
    - Partner Company, Workflow template and Contract Method (E-Contract) should be the same for all contracts.
    - The contracts are treated as a pack of contracts, and at the signature request process, to be treated as one batch. Hence the request notification email is to be send only one time for one batch.
- The user can get a single contract or the group of multiple contracts, which are in the sending box, per request.
- The user can edit a single contract or multiple contracts which is in the sending box, per request.
- The user can upload only one document for each contract at a time.

- Request:

    	]
    }
    ```

    ```json
    {
